# TalkiePi Setup Guide

Here are the steps required to setup a TalkiePi with a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a SeeedStudio ReSpeaker 2-Mic Pi HAT. These instructions assume you are using a Windows PC to configure the RPi.

By default TalkiePi will run without any arguments, it will autogenerate a username and then connect to Daniel Chote's mumble server.
You can change this behavior by appending commandline arguments of `-server YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS`, `-username YOUR_USERNAME` to the ExecStart line in `/etc/systemd/system/mumble.service` once installed.

TalkiePi will also accept arguments for `-password`, `-insecure`, `-certificate` and `-channel`, all defined in `cmd/talkiepi/main.go`, if you run your own mumble server, these will be self explanatory.

## Hardware Requirements
* (1) Raspberry Pi Zero W
* (1) [SeeedStudio ReSpeaker 2-Mic Pi HAT](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Respeaker_2_Mics_Pi_HAT/)
* (1) [Stereo speaker (3W, 8Ω) with JST connector](https://core-electronics.com.au/stereo-enclosed-speaker-3w-8.html)
* (1) MicroSD card, 16GB, class 10 with SD card adapter
* (1) Power adapter with micro USB cable
* (4) [M2.5 Brass Standoffs](https://core-electronics.com.au/brass-m2-5-standoffs-for-pi-hats-black-plated-pack-of-2.html)
* (4) M2.5 x 6 mm screws

## Install Operating System

Download the latest version of [Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/); older versions available [here](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/)

These instructions have been tested with:

~~~
Based on: Debian Stretch
Version: November 2017
Release date: 2017-11-29
Kernel version: 4.9
~~~

Write the image to a miroSD card with [Etcher](https://etcher.io/). Note, after the write is complete Windows will complain that the microSD card needs to be formatted. This message can be ignored. It is just that Windows cannot read the Linux partitions, but Windows can read the **Boot** partition which is the only one we need access to. 

Create two files on the **Boot** partition of the microSD card:

~~~
wpa_supplicant.conf
ssh
~~~

Below is a template for the wpa_supplicant.conf file. Please edit these details to match one or more wireless networks you intend to use. You can define as many networks as you like, if using only one network please delete the second network definition. Also, the two letter country code should match the country you are operating in.

Note, the file must be formatted with Unix style line end characters (i.e. LF not CR LF). [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is an example of a Windows based text editor that supports this.

~~~
country=AU
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    id_str="descriptive name for network 2"
    ssid="SSID2"
    psk="password2"
    priority=2
}

network={
    id_str="descriptive name for network 1"
    ssid="SSID1"
    psk="password1"
    priority=1
}
~~~

The ssh file should be empty.

Insert the microSD card into the RPi and apply power. The RPi will boot and attempt to connect one of the WiFi networks defined above with SSH enabled.

Use [Advanced Port Scanner](https://www.advanced-port-scanner.com/) or your router’s web interface to find the IP address of the RPi.

Use [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) to make an SSH connection to the RPi.

The default login credentials are:

~~~
rappberrypi login: pi
password: raspberry
~~~

Update repositories and upgrade software with:

~~~
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt upgrade
~~~

## Raspi-Config

Start the RPi configuration tool with this command:

~~~
$sudo raspi-config
~~~

Make the follow configuration changes:

1. Change User Password > Ok > YOUR_PASSWORD > YOUR_PASSWORD
1. Network Options > N1 Hostname > Ok > YOU_HOSTNAME > Ok
1. Localisation Options > I2 Change Timezone > YOUR_COUNTRY > YOUR_CITY
1. Localisation Options > I4 Change WiFi Country > YOUR_COUNTRY_CODE > Ok
1. Interfacing Options > P4 SPI > Yes > Ok
1. Advanced Options > A1 Expand Filesystem > Ok
1. Finish > Reboot? Yes

## Disable HDMI

To save power the HDMI output can be disabled at boot.

~~~
$sudo nano /etc/rc.local
~~~

Add the following lines above exit 0:

~~~
# Disable HDMI
/usr/bin/tvservice -o
~~~

## Git
